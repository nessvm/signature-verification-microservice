# Digital Signature
## Note:
This repo includes code to demonstrate usage of Django REST Framework to build an API that is compliant with some of the
best practices for building RESTful APIs proposed by Sam Ruby, Mike Amundsen, Leonard Richardson and Subbu Allamaraju.

Some of the code is purposely missing.

## Intended Use
The microservice originally built by this code may have been intended to be used as an internal tool to sign a digital
contract between the application and the user, this signature and its components were stored in databases with different
owners within the development team, in later states of the application flow this signature was used to ensure that the
terms of the contract contract weren't altered at any stage.
